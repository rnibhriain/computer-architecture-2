Question 2: 

procedure calls: 40060019
The procedure is called this number of times. 

maximum window depth: 29
This as the highest number of times the function will be called.


					6		8		16
number of register overflows:		40060015	40060013	40060005
The overflows for each of the different number of register windows.


number of register underflows:	0
It didnt seem to underflow.



Question 3: 
Time it takes to run: 2239.38ms
The method I used was I got the time from a clock right before running the function.
And then just after it returned I got the current time for the clock. I then took the 
first time away from the second time and got the number of milliseconds as a double. 
I ran this ten times and got an average.
